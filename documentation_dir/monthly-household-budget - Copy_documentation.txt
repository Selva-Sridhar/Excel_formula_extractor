================================================================================


================================================================================
SHEET: Budget
================================================================================

================================================================================
PART 1: FULL OVERVIEW
================================================================================

1.1 Sheet Purpose
   The primary purpose of the "Budget" sheet is to track and analyze financial performance by comparing budgeted amounts against actual expenditures and income. It serves as a comprehensive financial overview, breaking down finances into various categories such as income, home expenses, savings, daily living, and more. The sheet highlights variances, allowing users to understand where they are over or under budget.

1.2 Sheet Structure
   The sheet is structured around multiple Excel Tables, each representing a specific financial category (e.g., Income, Savings, Home Expenses). Each table likely contains individual line items with columns for "Budget" and "Actual" amounts. The sheet then aggregates these individual items into subtotal rows for each category, followed by overarching grand totals or net calculations. Column 'D' and 'I' are consistently used to display the 'Difference' or variance for individual line items and category totals, respectively. Dynamic headers using concatenation are used for category total rows.

1.3 Key Calculations
   1.  Variance Calculation (Budget vs. Actual): The most frequent calculation, `=([Budget]-[Actual])` or `=([Actual]-[Budget])`, determines the difference between planned and spent/received amounts for individual line items and categories. This indicates overspending or savings.
   2.  Category Subtotals: Formulas like `=SUBTOTAL(9,[Budget])` sum up the "Budget", "Actual", and "Difference" for each financial category, providing a quick summary of performance within those categories.
   3.  Grand Totals/Net Balances: Formulas like `=Table2[[#Totals],[Budget]]` and `=SUM(Table5[[#Totals],[Budget]], ...)` aggregate totals from multiple tables to calculate overall income, overall expenses, and ultimately the net budget, net actual, and net variance.
   4.  Dynamic Category Headers: Formulas such as `="Total " & Table2[[#Headers],[INCOME]]` generate descriptive total labels for each category dynamically, ensuring consistency and ease of updates.

1.4 Data Flow
   Input Sources: The primary input comes from numerous Excel Tables (e.g., Table2 for Income, Table5 through Table21 for various expense categories). These tables hold the detailed "Budget" and "Actual" figures for individual financial line items.

   Processing:
   1.  Individual Variances: For each line item within a table, a subtraction formula calculates the 'Difference' between "Actual" and "Budget" (or vice versa).
   2.  Category Subtotals: `SUBTOTAL` functions then aggregate these "Budget", "Actual", and "Difference" values for entire categories, typically displayed in dedicated "Total" rows.
   3.  Grand Aggregations: `SUM` formulas gather the `[[#Totals],[Budget]]` or `[[#Totals],[Actual]]` from multiple specific tables to compute overall financial summaries (e.g., total income, total expenses).
   4.  Net Calculations: Further subtraction formulas combine these grand aggregations to determine net budget, net actual, and the final net variance for the entire budget.

   Outputs: The sheet outputs detailed variances per line item, summarized financial performance per category, and overall net financial positions and variances. Dynamic text labels for category totals improve readability.

PART 2: FORMULA DOCUMENTATION (GROUPED BY PATTERN)
================================================================================

Pattern: SUBTRACTION

  Formula Examples:
    1.  Readable Formula: =[Actual]-[Budget]
        Mathematical Notation: Actual - Budget = Difference
        Occurrence Count: 8 formulas follow this pattern
        Applied to Cells: D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12
        Purpose: This formula calculates the numerical difference between an 'Actual' value and a 'Budget' value, resulting in a 'Difference' or variance. It's used to identify if actual spending or income exceeded or fell short of the budget.
        Dependencies: Depends on the 'Actual' column and the 'Budget' column within the same row or contextual range.
        Business Context: Provides immediate feedback on financial performance at an individual line-item level. A positive difference indicates Actual > Budget (e.g., more income than budgeted, or more expenses than budgeted).

    2.  Readable Formula: =[Budget]-[Actual]
        Mathematical Notation: Budget - Actual = Difference
        Occurrence Count: 108 formulas follow this pattern
        Applied to Cells: D16, I16, D17, I17, D18, I18, D19, I19, D20, I20, D21, I21, D22, I22, D23, D24, D25, D26, I26, D27, I27, D28, I28, I29, I30, I31, D32, I32, D33, I33, D34, I34, D35, D36, D37, D38, I38, D39, I39, D40, I40, D41, I41, I42, D45, D46, I46, D47, I47, D48, I48, D49, I49, D50, I50, D51, I51, D52, I52, I53, I54, I55, D56, I56, D57, D58, D59, D60, I60, D61, I61, I62, I63, D65, D66, D67, I67, D68, I68, D69, I69, I70, I71, D73, D74, D75, I75, D76, I76, D77, I77, I78, I79, I80, D81, D82, D83, I84, I85, I86, D87, I87, D88, I88, D89, I89, D90, I90
        Purpose: This is the inverse variance calculation, determining the difference between a 'Budget' value and an 'Actual' value. It is predominantly used for individual line items and aggregated categories to show how much was "left over" or "overspent" from the budget.
        Dependencies: Depends on the 'Budget' column and the 'Actual' column within the same row or contextual range.
        Business Context: The most common way to display budget variance, where a positive number signifies savings or being under budget, and a negative number indicates overspending.

    3.  Readable Formula: =[Actual]-[Difference]
        Mathematical Notation: (Total Budget) - (Total Actual) = Overall Variance
        Occurrence Count: 2 formulas follow this pattern
        Applied to Cells: I5, I6
        Purpose: Calculates the difference between an 'Actual' aggregate value and a 'Difference' aggregate value. In context (e.g., I5 being G5-H5), G5 represents 'Total Budget' for a category (like Income) and H5 represents 'Total Actual' for that category. The formula, therefore, calculates the variance between the total budgeted and total actual amounts for that specific aggregation.
        Dependencies: Depends on specific aggregate values. For I5, it depends on G5 (Total Budget Income) and H5 (Total Actual Income).
        Business Context: Provides a summary variance for larger financial components, like total income or a specific expense grouping. Note: The column names 'Actual' and 'Difference' in the readable formula are contextual and may refer to different underlying values (like 'Total Budget' and 'Total Actual') than their literal meaning.

    4.  Readable Formula: =[Actual]-[Actual]
        Mathematical Notation: (Total Income Budget) - (Total Expenses Budget) = Net Budget
        Occurrence Count: 1 formula follows this pattern
        Applied to Cells: G7
        Purpose: Calculates a net balance by subtracting a total expense budget from a total income budget. It gives the net financial position based on budgeted figures.
        Dependencies: Depends on two aggregate 'Actual' values. In context (G7 being G5-G6), G5 is the 'Total Budget Income' and G6 is the 'Total Budget Expenses'.
        Business Context: Crucial for determining overall financial health according to the budget, indicating projected surplus or deficit.

    5.  Readable Formula: =[Difference]-[Difference]
        Mathematical Notation: (Total Income Actual) - (Total Expenses Actual) = Net Actual
        Occurrence Count: 1 formula follows this pattern
        Applied to Cells: H7
        Purpose: Calculates a net balance by subtracting total actual expenses from total actual income. It gives the real net financial position.
        Dependencies: Depends on two aggregate 'Difference' values. In context (H7 being H5-H6), H5 is the 'Total Actual Income' and H6 is the 'Total Actual Expenses'.
        Business Context: Shows the actual financial surplus or deficit after all income and expenses are accounted for.

    6.  Readable Formula: =[Difference]-[Actual]
        Mathematical Notation: (Net Actual) - (Net Budget) = Net Variance
        Occurrence Count: 1 formula follows this pattern
        Applied to Cells: I7
        Purpose: Calculates the variance between the Net Actual financial position and the Net Budgeted financial position.
        Dependencies: Depends on the overall 'Net Actual' (H7) and 'Net Budget' (G7) calculations.
        Business Context: Provides the ultimate variance figure, indicating whether the entire financial picture performed better or worse than budgeted.

Pattern: ADDITION/SUM

  Formula Examples:
    1.  Readable Formula: =SUM(,Table5[[#Totals],[Budget]],Table20[[#Totals],[Budget]],...)
        Mathematical Notation: SUM(Total Budget from Table5, Total Budget from Table20, ...) = Grand Total Budget Expenses
        Occurrence Count: 1 formula follows this pattern
        Applied to Cells: G6
        Purpose: This formula sums the 'Budget' totals from multiple structured Excel Tables, aggregating all budgeted expenses into a single grand total. The initial blank argument (`,`) is syntactically redundant but harmless.
        Dependencies: Depends on the `[[#Totals],[Budget]]` row of numerous expense tables (Table5, Table6, Table7, Table8, Table10, Table11, Table12, Table13, Table14, Table15, Table16, Table17, Table18, Table19, Table20, Table21).
        Business Context: Provides a comprehensive overview of the total budgeted expenses across all categories, essential for high-level budget analysis and net calculations.

    2.  Readable Formula: =SUM(Table5[[#Totals],[Actual]],Table20[[#Totals],[Actual]],...)
        Mathematical Notation: SUM(Total Actual from Table5, Total Actual from Table20, ...) = Grand Total Actual Expenses
        Occurrence Count: 1 formula follows this pattern
        Applied to Cells: H6
        Purpose: This formula sums the 'Actual' totals from multiple structured Excel Tables, aggregating all actual expenses into a single grand total.
        Dependencies: Depends on the `[[#Totals],[Actual]]` row of numerous expense tables (Table5, Table6, Table7, Table8, Table10, Table11, Table12, Table13, Table14, Table15, Table16, Table17, Table18, Table19, Table20, Table21).
        Business Context: Provides a comprehensive overview of the total actual expenses across all categories, essential for high-level budget analysis and net calculations.

Pattern: TABLE REFERENCES (Direct Value Extraction)

        Mathematical Notation: Value from the 'Totals' row of the 'Budget' column in Table2
        Occurrence Count: 1 formula follows this pattern
        Applied to Cells: G5
        Purpose: This formula directly extracts the aggregated 'Budget' total from the designated totals row of 'Table2'. Table2 likely represents the Income category.
        Dependencies: Directly depends on the structured data in 'Table2', specifically its totals row for the 'Budget' column.
        Business Context: Used to bring in a specific category's overall budget total for further grand total or net calculations.

    2.  Readable Formula: =Table2[[#Totals],[Actual]]
        Mathematical Notation: Value from the 'Totals' row of the 'Actual' column in Table2
        Occurrence Count: 1 formula follows this pattern
        Applied to Cells: H5
        Purpose: This formula directly extracts the aggregated 'Actual' total from the designated totals row of 'Table2'. Table2 likely represents the Income category.
        Dependencies: Directly depends on the structured data in 'Table2', specifically its totals row for the 'Actual' column.
        Business Context: Used to bring in a specific category's overall actual total for further grand total or net calculations.

Pattern: SUBTOTAL/AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

  Formula Examples:
    1.  Readable Formula: =SUBTOTAL(9,[Budget])
        Mathematical Notation: SUBTOTAL(Function_Code_9, [Budget Column Range]) = Sum of visible 'Budget' values
        Occurrence Count: 17 formulas follow this pattern
        Applied to Cells: B13, G23, B29, G35, B42, G43, B53, G57, B62, G64, B70, G72, B78, G81, B84, B91, G91
        Purpose: This formula calculates the sum of all visible numeric values within the 'Budget' column of the current range, typically the column of an Excel Table. Function Code 9 represents the SUM function, which automatically adjusts when rows are filtered or hidden, providing dynamic totals.
        Dependencies: Depends on the data within the '[Budget]' column of the current active table or range where the formula resides.
        Business Context: Provides flexible category totals for budgeted amounts. If the user filters the data within a table, this subtotal will automatically update to reflect only the visible items, which is extremely useful for interactive analysis.

    2.  Readable Formula: =SUBTOTAL(9,[Actual])
        Mathematical Notation: SUBTOTAL(Function_Code_9, [Actual Column Range]) = Sum of visible 'Actual' values
        Occurrence Count: 17 formulas follow this pattern
        Applied to Cells: C13, H23, C29, H35, C42, H43, C53, H57, C62, H64, C70, H72, C78, H81, C84, C91, H91
        Purpose: Similar to the Budget subtotal, this formula calculates the sum of all visible numeric values within the 'Actual' column of the current range or table. It adjusts dynamically with filtering.
        Dependencies: Depends on the data within the '[Actual]' column of the current active table or range.
        Business Context: Provides flexible category totals for actual expenditures/income, dynamically adjusting to filters for focused analysis.

    3.  Readable Formula: =SUBTOTAL(9,[Difference])

        Purpose: This formula calculates the sum of all visible numeric values within the 'Difference' (variance) column of the current range or table, dynamically adjusting with filtering.
        Dependencies: Depends on the data within the '[Difference]' column of the current active table or range, which itself depends on 'Budget' and 'Actual' columns.
        Business Context: Provides flexible category totals for variances, allowing users to see the total over/under budget for visible items after applying filters.

Pattern: TEXT/CONCATENATION

  Formula Examples:
    1.  Readable Formula: ="Total " & Table2[[#Headers],[INCOME]]
        Mathematical Notation: "Total " concatenated with the header of the 'INCOME' column from Table2
        Occurrence Count: 19 formulas follow this pattern
        Applied to Cells: A13, F23, A29, F35, A42, F43, A53, F57, A62, F64, A70, F72, A78, F81, A84, A91, F91
        Purpose: This formula dynamically creates a text label for total rows by concatenating the literal string "Total " with the actual header text of a specific column (e.g., "INCOME") from a named Excel Table.
        Dependencies: Depends on the header row (`[[#Headers]]`) of the specified table (e.g., Table2, Table6, Table5) and column (e.g., `[INCOME]`, `[SAVINGS]`).
        Business Context: Ensures that summary rows have consistent and dynamically generated labels. If the header of the source table column changes, the "Total" label will update automatically, reducing maintenance effort and improving accuracy.

================================================================================
PART 3: DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

3.1 Formula Dependencies
   The formulas in the sheet exhibit a hierarchical dependency structure, where raw data from tables feeds into intermediate calculations (variances, subtotals), which then feed into higher-level aggregations and net results.

   1.  Individual Variances:
       -   Cells D5-D12 (=[Actual]-[Budget]) depend on their respective 'Actual' and 'Budget' cells (e.g., D5 depends on C5 and B5).
       -   Cells D16-D23, D24-D28, D32-D34, D36-D41, D45-D52, D56, D58-D61, D65-D69, D73-D77, D81-D83, D87-D90 (=[Budget]-[Actual]) depend on their respective 'Budget' and 'Actual' cells (e.g., D16 depends on B16 and C16).
       -   Cells I16-I22, I26-I28, I32-I34, I38-I41, I46-I52, I56, I60-I61, I67-I69, I75-I77, I87-I90 (=[Budget]-[Actual]) depend on their respective 'Budget' and 'Actual' cells.

   2.  Category Subtotals:
       -   Cells B13, G23, B29, etc. (=SUBTOTAL(9,[Budget])) depend on the 'Budget' column within their respective tables/ranges.
       -   Cells C13, H23, C29, etc. (=SUBTOTAL(9,[Actual])) depend on the 'Actual' column within their respective tables/ranges.
       -   Cells D13, I23, D29, etc. (=SUBTOTAL(9,[Difference])) depend on the 'Difference' column within their respective tables/ranges (which in turn depends on 'Budget' and 'Actual' columns).

   3.  Grand Totals / Overall Net Calculations:
       -   Cell G5 (=Table2[[#Totals],[Budget]]) depends on Table2.
       -   Cell H5 (=Table2[[#Totals],[Actual]]) depends on Table2.
       -   Cell G6 (=SUM(Table5[[#Totals],[Budget]], ...)) depends on Table5, Table20, Table21, Table19, Table15, Table16, Table17, Table18, Table14, Table13, Table12, Table11, Table10, Table8, Table7, Table6.
       -   Cell H6 (=SUM(Table5[[#Totals],[Actual]], ...)) depends on the same tables as G6.
       -   Cell I5 (=[Actual]-[Difference]) depends on G5 and H5, therefore indirectly on Table2.
       -   Cell G7 (=[Actual]-[Actual]) depends on G5 and G6, therefore indirectly on Table2 and all expense tables.
       -   Cell H7 (=[Difference]-[Difference]) depends on H5 and H6, therefore indirectly on Table2 and all expense tables.
       -   Cell I7 (=[Difference]-[Actual]) depends on H7 and G7, therefore indirectly on Table2 and all expense tables.

   4.  Dynamic Category Headers:
       -   Cells A13, F23, A29, etc. (="Total " & TableX[[#Headers],[COLUMN]]) depend on the header row of their respective tables (e.g., Table2, Table6).

3.2 Table Dependencies
   Structured Excel Tables are central to this sheet's functionality.
   -   Table2: Heavily used for overall Income Budget and Actual totals (G5, H5) and for generating the "Total INCOME" header (A13).
   -   Table5, Table6, Table7, Table8, Table10, Table11, Table12, Table13, Table14, Table15, Table16, Table17, Table18, Table19, Table20, Table21: These 16 tables are heavily used for:
       -   Contributing to the grand total expense calculations (G6, H6).
       -   Generating dynamic "Total" headers for their respective categories (e.g., Table6 for F23, Table5 for A29).
       -   Implicitly, these tables contain the individual 'Budget' and 'Actual' columns that feed into the `SUBTOTAL` formulas (e.g., `SUBTOTAL(9,[Budget])` within each table's context).

   The tables are most heavily used for their `[[#Totals],[Budget]]` and `[[#Totals],[Actual]]` attributes to provide aggregated values for higher-level sum calculations, and for `[[#Headers],[COLUMN]]` to create dynamic labels.

3.3 Cross-Reference Map
   Source Data -> Intermediate Calculations -> Final Results

   1.  Individual Table Data (e.g., Table2[Budget], Table2[Actual])
       -> Individual Line Item Differences (e.g., D5:D12, D16:D23, etc.)
       -> Category Subtotals (e.g., B13, C13, D13, etc. using SUBTOTAL)
       -> Table Totals (e.g., Table2[[#Totals],[Budget]], Table5[[#Totals],[Actual]] etc., which are often implicitly calculated within tables)

   2.  Table Totals for Income (Table2[[#Totals],[Budget]], Table2[[#Totals],[Actual]])
       -> G5 (Total Budget Income), H5 (Total Actual Income)
       -> I5 (Income Variance: Total Budget Income - Total Actual Income)

   3.  Table Totals for Expenses (Table5, Table6, ..., Table21 for [[#Totals],[Budget]] and [[#Totals],[Actual]])
       -> G6 (Grand Total Budget Expenses)
       -> H6 (Grand Total Actual Expenses)
       -> I6 (Expense Variance: Grand Total Budget Expenses - Grand Total Actual Expenses)

   4.  Aggregated Totals:
       G5 (Total Budget Income) & G6 (Grand Total Budget Expenses)
       -> G7 (Net Budget: Total Budget Income - Grand Total Budget Expenses)

       H5 (Total Actual Income) & H6 (Grand Total Actual Expenses)
       -> H7 (Net Actual: Total Actual Income - Grand Total Actual Expenses)

   5.  Final Overall Variance:
       G7 (Net Budget) & H7 (Net Actual)
       -> I7 (Net Variance: Net Actual - Net Budget)

   This shows a clear progression from granular data to high-level financial summary.

3.4 Circular References & Issues
   Based on the provided unique formulas and their dependencies, there are no immediate signs of circular references. The dependencies flow in a clear, unidirectional manner from raw data to aggregated results. No broken or suspicious dependencies are explicitly identified in the formula structures themselves; however, the inconsistent naming of 'Actual' and 'Difference' in certain `readable_formula` fields for cells like I5 (where 'Actual' refers to a budget total and 'Difference' refers to an actual total) could be confusing for a user trying to interpret the formula's purpose without deep context. This is more of a clarity issue than a functional error.

================================================================================
PART 4: INSIGHTS & ANALYSIS
================================================================================

4.1 Formula Patterns Identified
   The dominant calculation pattern is SUBTRACTION for variance analysis, with 120 occurrences across various forms (e.g., `[Actual]-[Budget]`, `[Budget]-[Actual]`, and variations for aggregated totals). This highlights the sheet's core purpose of tracking deviations from budget. The next most frequent pattern is SUBTOTAL, used 51 times for dynamic aggregation of budget, actual, and difference figures within categories. TEXT/CONCATENATION is also significant (19 times) for dynamic header generation. SUM and direct TABLE REFERENCES are used less frequently but are critical for grand totals. The sheet effectively employs these patterns to create a multi-layered financial overview.

4.2 Best Practices Observed
   1.  Extensive use of Excel Tables: The sheet leverages structured table references (`TableX[[#Totals],[Column]]`, `TableX[[#Headers],[Column]]`) which is excellent for data integrity and maintainability. Formulas automatically adjust if rows are added or removed from tables.
   2.  Dynamic Aggregation with SUBTOTAL: The consistent use of `SUBTOTAL(9,...)` for category totals is a strong best practice. It allows users to filter data within tables, and the totals will automatically update to reflect only the visible rows, enhancing analytical flexibility.
   3.  Dynamic Headers: Concatenating "Total " with table headers creates robust and self-updating labels for summary rows, reducing manual effort and potential for errors if category names change.
   4.  Consistency in Variance Calculation: While there are two inverse patterns for variance (`Actual - Budget` and `Budget - Actual`), they are applied consistently across different types of data, indicating a clear methodology.

4.3 Potential Issues
   1.  Ambiguous `readable_formula` Naming: For formulas like `=[Actual]-[Difference]` (e.g., I5), where `Actual` actually refers to a Budget total (G5) and `Difference` refers to an Actual total (H5) based on the cell references, the `readable_formula` is highly misleading. This can cause significant confusion for anyone reviewing or modifying the sheet.
   2.  Overly Long SUM Formulas: The `SUM` formulas for grand total expenses (G6, H6) concatenate 16 individual table references. While functional, this formula becomes very long and cumbersome to read or modify. If more expense categories are added, it will only grow, making maintenance challenging.
   3.  Redundant Argument in SUM: The formula for G6 includes a blank first argument (`=SUM(,Table5...)`). While Excel often tolerates this, it's technically a minor imperfection and suggests a potential copy-paste artifact.
   4.  Lack of Named Ranges for Aggregates: While tables are named, the intermediate aggregate cells like G5, H5, G6, H6 (Total Income Budget, Total Actual Income, Grand Total Budget Expenses, Grand Total Actual Expenses) are not explicitly named. This forces complex formulas like G7, H7, I7 to rely on cell references (G5, G6, H5, H6) rather than more readable named ranges, slightly reducing clarity.

4.4 Key Findings
   1.  Robust Budget-to-Actual Comparison: The sheet is meticulously designed to compare budgeted figures against actuals, with a strong emphasis on calculating variances at multiple levels of granularity.
   2.  Heavy Reliance on Structured Tables: The foundation of the sheet is a well-organized set of Excel Tables, enabling flexible data management and formula extensibility.
   3.  Multi-level Aggregation: Calculations span from individual line item differences to category subtotals (using SUBTOTAL) and culminate in comprehensive grand totals and net financial positions (using SUM and subsequent subtractions).
   4.  Dynamic Reporting Capabilities: The use of SUBTOTAL and dynamic text headers facilitates flexible analysis, allowing users to filter data and still see accurate summary information.
   5.  Clarity vs. Accuracy Challenge: While the formulas are numerically accurate, some `readable_formula` interpretations for aggregated variance calculations present a naming ambiguity that could hinder user comprehension and trust.

4.5 Recommendations
   1.  Standardize Naming Conventions for Aggregates: Review and rename any contextual headers or implicitly referenced cells (like G5, H5, etc.) to ensure that the `readable_formula` accurately reflects the meaning of the data being referenced. For example, ensure that a cell truly represents "Actual" if it's named "Actual" in a formula.
   2.  Simplify Grand Total SUM Formulas: Consider using a different approach for summing totals from many tables. If all expense tables are on the same sheet and consistently named (e.g., Table_Expense_1, Table_Expense_2), a dynamic named range or a `SUMPRODUCT` with `INDIRECT` could potentially simplify the long `SUM` formulas for G6 and H6, or use a helper column to sum totals more concisely.
   3.  Correct Minor Formula Syntax: Remove the redundant blank argument from the `SUM` formula in G6 to maintain clean syntax.
   4.  Implement Named Ranges for Key Aggregates: Create explicit named ranges for cells like G5 ("TotalIncomeBudget"), H5 ("TotalIncomeActual"), G6 ("TotalExpenseBudget"), H6 ("TotalExpenseActual"), and the net results (G7, H7, I7). This would significantly improve the readability and maintainability of dependent formulas like `G7 = TotalIncomeBudget - TotalExpenseBudget`.
   5.  Provide Internal Documentation: Given the potential for ambiguity in some formula labels, consider adding comments to key cells or a dedicated "Formulas Explained" section within the sheet to clarify complex dependencies or contextual meanings.
